# TTK4135 - Optimization and Control (NTNU)

This repo includes the lab report for the Helicopter project we did in TTK4135.

In groups of two student the task was to control a helicopter using optimization.

The course treats optimization. The candidates learn to formulate optimization problems and solve these through appropriate algorithms and software. Optimality conditions like the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions are discussed and conditions for global and local conditions are analyzed. Key optimization classes of problems including linear programming (LP), quadratic programming (QP) and nonlinear programming (NP) are studied and applied in different settings. The course includes advanced control of dynamic systems with emphasis on Model Predictive Control (MPC).
